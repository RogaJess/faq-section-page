FAQ Accordion Challenge
This project is an implementation of the FAQ Accordion challenge from Frontendmentor.io. I completed it using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The challenge involves creating an interactive FAQ section with an accordion-style interface.
Design is Desktop + Tablet compatible.
